## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

This is a Next.js 14 frontend application that serves as a comprehensive guild management dashboard. It connects to a separate backend API to fetch guild data, player statistics, and raid progression information.

### Backend API

The backend API server for this application can be found at: [https://github.com/thedanzor/world-of-warcraft-api](https://github.com/thedanzor/world-of-warcraft-api)

The backend is an Express.js API server that:
- Fetches guild data from the Battle.net API
- Processes character information, gear, and statistics
- Provides real-time data updates via WebSocket
- Manages MongoDB data storage
- Handles authentication and rate limiting
- Supports both Retail and Classic WoW guilds

### Tech Stack
- **Framework**: Next.js 14 (App Router)
- **UI Library**: Material-UI (MUI) v5
- **Styling**: SCSS + Tailwind CSS
- **State Management**: React Hooks
- **Charts**: Recharts
- **Drag & Drop**: React DnD
- **Fonts**: Google Fonts (Poppins, Public Sans)

## üîß Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory with the following variables:

```bash
# Backend API Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:8000
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLIENT_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:8000

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning

This project is currently being refactored to be brought to the open source community. There's still some messy code here that needs to be cleaned up. Please be aware that:

- Some components may have inconsistent coding patterns
- Documentation may be incomplete in certain areas
- Error handling may need improvement
- Code organization is still being optimized

I'm actively working on improving code quality and documentation.

### Medium Priority
- Clean up inconsistent code patterns
- Improve error handling across all components
- Improve the UI / Design

### Low Priority
- Add more customization options for guild requirements
- Improve accessibility features

## üÜò Support
